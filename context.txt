Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make predictions from data without explicit programming. It encompasses various learning types, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, relying on data for training and feature engineering. Machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks and decision trees, are trained to understand data patterns and make predictions, with evaluation and validation crucial for model performance. Managing overfitting and hyperparameter tuning are essential considerations. Deep learning, involving multi-layer neural networks, has revolutionized areas like image and speech recognition. Its applications span across diverse domains, including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, although ethical and legal challenges, like bias and privacy, require careful attention.
